This is a folder containing exercises that manipulate data at the bit level. The folders contents are numbered from 0 and have can be described as follows:


0. A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1. A function that printx the binary representation of a number.
2. A function that returns the value of a bit at a  given index.
3. A function that sets a value to 1 at a given index.
4. A functin that sets a value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
6. A function that checks the endiannes.
7. A function that contains a password for a provided crackme3 program.

An include guarded main.h file comntaining all the prototypes and header files will be included.

The use of global variables, five functions per file, printf, calloc, puts and realloc is forbiden.

The main.c files for the different questions are provided for guidance.

A _putchar.c file has been provided and will be used where necessary.
