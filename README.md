This is my first C programming language project.

Directory 0x00-hello_world has files containing code used in the different stages of compilation.

Directory 0x01-variables_if_else_while contains simple code using loops.

Directory 0x02-functions_nested_loops contains examples of code using nested loops in advanced levels.
 
Directory 0x03-debugging project has code that aims to fix errors.

Directory 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops contains more nested loops exercises.

Directory 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings contains code introducing the concept of pointers and arrays.

Directory 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings has code using buffers, string manipulation and pointers.

Directory 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings contains code dealing with strings of two dimensions among other functions.

Directory 0x08-recursion contains exercises that have functions calling functions within them.

Directory 0x0A-argc_argv contains code utilizing the argc argv[] arguments.

Directory 0x09-static_libraries contains a static library file, a bash script that when executed creates a static library and a main header with all prototypes.

Directory 0x0B-malloc_free contains files that utilize malloc free functions.

Directory 0x0C-more_malloc_free contains more files utilizing malloc function to allocate memory and free function to free memory.

Directory 0x0D-preprocessor has tasks that are compiled upto the preprocessor stage before being manipulated.

0x0E-structures_typedef contains tasks that create the data type struct.

Directory 0x0F-function_pointers contains tasks that create pointers whne calling functions.

Directory 0x10-variadic_functions has files with variadic functions called in them.

Directory 0x12-singly_linked_lists creates and manipulates singly linked lists.

Directory 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists has more tasks aimed at improving singly linked lists knowledge.

Directory 0x14 has tasks that manipulate data at the bit level.

Directory 0x15 has tasks that pertain POSIX environment.

Directory 0x17 has tasks that create doubly linked lists.


There are additional README.md files in each directory that helps explain the tasks in detail, main.h files and main.c or _putchar _files that are either used to call functions or are called in functions.
