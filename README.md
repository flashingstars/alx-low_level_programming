This is my first C programming language project.

Directory 0x00-hello_world has files containing code used in the different stages of compilation.

Directory 0x01-variables_if_else_while contains simple code using loops.

Directory 0x02-functions_nested_loops contains examples of code using nested loops in advanced levels.
 
Directory 0x03-debugging project has code that aims to fix errors.

Directory 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops contains more nested loops exercises.

Directory 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings contains code introducing the concept of pointers and arrays.

Directory 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings has code using buffers, string manipulation and pointers.

Directory 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings contains code dealing with strings of two dimensions among other functions.

Directory 0x08-recursion contains exercises that have functions calling functions within them.

Directory 0x0A-argc_argv contains code utilizing the argc argv[] arguments.

There are additional README.md files in each directory that helps explain the tasks in detail, main.h files and main.c or _putchar _files that are either used to call functions or are called in functions.
