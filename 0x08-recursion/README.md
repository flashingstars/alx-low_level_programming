5. Program that returns the natural square root of a number.

6. Program that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns 0.

7. A program that returns 1 if a string reads the same backwards as forwards (palindrome) and 0 if not.

8. A program that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.


The directory also has a main.h file that contains all the prototypes called in every sourcecode.


Since standard library is not allowed, the _putchar.c file _at the root of the folder will be called to display characters.
