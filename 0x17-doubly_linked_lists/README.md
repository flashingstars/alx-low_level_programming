This is a directory with tasks aimed at creating doubly linked lists and manipulating them. Each task is described as follows.

0. A function that prints all elements of a dlistint_t list.

1. A function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.

2. A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.

3. A function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list

4. A function that frees a dlistint_t list.

5. A function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.

6. A function that returns the sum of all the data(n) of a dlistint_t linked list.

7. A function that inserts a new node at a given position.

8. A function that deletes the node at index of a dlistint_t linked list.

No more than five functions are allowed per file.

Betty code style is used.

A README file is mandatory at the root of the directory.

Global variables are not allowed.

Only C standard library functions allowed are printf, malloc, free and exit.
